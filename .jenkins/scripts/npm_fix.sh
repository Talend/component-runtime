# Correct npm behavior https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scripts#user
# > When npm is run as root, scripts are always run with the effective uid and gid of the working directory owner.
#
# As build is run under root, target folder is created and owned by root.
# But, as specified above, the npm process takes the uid/guid of cwd ie as talend (1000), so when generating
# documentation via antora the process fails w/ :
# FATAL (antora): EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '.../documentation/target/documentation-1.43.0-SNAPSHOT/main'
#
# TODO: check for other modules using npm
# - component-tools
# - component-tools-webapp
# - component-starter-server
