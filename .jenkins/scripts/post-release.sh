# you have git and maven, you set the environment varaible `release` and
# that you already ran the following command:
# $ mvn release:prepare release:perform
#
# To launch a full release in one line, use (don't forget to set the release you are doingg):
# $ mvn release:prepare release:perform && release=1.0.3 ./post-release.sh
#

# ensure it is on the remote repo if needed - /!\ assumes the default remote is right
