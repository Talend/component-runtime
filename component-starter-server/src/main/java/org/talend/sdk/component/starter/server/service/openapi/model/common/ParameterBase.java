/**
 * Describes a single operation parameter.
 *
 * A unique parameter is defined by a combination of a name and location.
 * Parameter Locations
 *
 * There are four possible parameter locations specified by the in field:
 * <ul>
 * <li>path - Used together with Path Templating, where the parameter value is actually part of the operation's URL.
 * This does not include the host or base path of the API. For example, in /items/{itemId}, the path parameter is
 * itemId.</li>
 * <li>query - Parameters that are appended to the URL. For example, in /items?id=###, the query parameter is id.</li>
 * <li>header - Custom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that RFC7230 states header names are case
 * insensitive.</li>
 * <li>cookie - Used to pass a specific cookie value to the API.</li>
 * </ul>
