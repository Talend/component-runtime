:keywords: input, partition mapper, producer, emitter

Input components are the components generally placed at the beginning of a Talend job. They are in charge of retrieving the data that will later be processed in the job.

An input component is primarily made of three distinct logics:

- The execution logic of the component itself, defined through a partition mapper.
- The configurable part of the component, defined through the mapper configuration.
- The source logic defined through a producer.

Before implementing the component logic and defining its layout and configurable fields, make sure you have specified its basic metadata, as detailed in xref:component-registering.adoc[this document].
