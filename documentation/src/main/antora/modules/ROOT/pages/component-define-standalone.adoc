Standalone components are the components without input or output flows. They are designed to do actions without reading or processing any data. For example standalone components can be used to create indexes in databases.

Before implementing the component logic and defining its layout and configurable fields, make sure you have specified its basic metadata, as detailed in xref:component-registering.adoc[this document].
