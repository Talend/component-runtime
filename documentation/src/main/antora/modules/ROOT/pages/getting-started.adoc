//== Introducing Talend Component Kit

_Talend Component Kit_ is a Java framework designed to simplify the development of components at two levels:

* The **Runtime**, that injects the specific component code into a job or pipeline. The framework helps unifying as much as possible the code required to run in Data Integration (DI) and BEAM environments.
* The **Graphical interface**. The framework helps unifying the code required to render the component in a browser or in the Eclipse-based Talend Studio (SWT).

Most part of the development happens as a Maven or Gradle project and requires a dedicated tool such as IntelliJ.

The Component Kit is made of:

* A Starter, that is a graphical interface allowing you to define the skeleton of your development project.
* APIs to implement components UI and runtime.
* Development tools: Maven and Gradle wrappers, validation rules, packaging, Web preview, etc.
* A testing kit based on JUnit 4 and 5.

By using this tooling in a development environment, you can start creating components as described below.

== Component types

There are four types of components, each type coming with its specificities, especially on the runtime side.

* Input components: Retrieve the data to process from a defined source. An input component is made of:
** The execution logic of the component, represented by a `Mapper` or an `Emitter` class.
** The source logic of the component, represented by a `Source` class.
** The layout of the component and the configuration that the end-user will need to provide when using the component, defined by a `Configuration` class. All input components must have a dataset specified in their configuration, and every dataset must use a datastore.
* Processors: Process and transform the data. A processor is made of:
** The execution logic of the component, describing how to process each records or batches of records it receives. It also describes how to pass records to its output connections. This logic is defined in a `Processor` class.
** The layout of the component and the configuration that the end-user will need to provide when using the component, defined by a `Configuration` class.
* Output components: Send the processed data to a defined destination. An output component is made of:
** The execution logic of the component, describing how to process each records or batches of records it receives. This logic is defined in an `Output` class. Unlike processors, output components are the last components of the execution and return no data.
** The layout of the component and the configuration that the end-user will need to provide when using the component, defined by a `Configuration` class. All output components must have a dataset specified in their configuration, and every dataset must use a datastore.
* Standalone components: Make a call to the service or run a query on the database. A standalone component is made of:
** The execution logic of the component, represented by a `DriverRunner` class.
** The layout of the component and the configuration that the end-user will need to provide when using the component, defined by a `Configuration` class. All input components must have a datastore or dataset specified in their configuration, and every dataset must use a datastore.

The following example shows the different classes of an input components in a multi-component development project:
