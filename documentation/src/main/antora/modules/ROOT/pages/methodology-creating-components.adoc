[[getting-started-principles]]

Developing new components using the Component Kit framework includes:

. xref:index-generating-project.adoc[Creating a project] using the https://starter-toolkit.talend.io/[starter] or the xref:installing-talend-intellij-plugin.adoc[Talend IntelliJ plugin]. This step allows to build the skeleton of the project. It consists in:
.. Defining the general configuration model for each component in your project.
.. Generating and downloading the project archive from the starter.
.. Compiling the project.
. Importing the compiled project in your IDE. This step is not required if you have generated the project using the IntelliJ plugin.
. xref:index-creating-components.adoc[Implementing the components], including:
.. Registering the components by specifying their metadata: family, categories, version, icon, type and name.
.. Defining the layout and configurable part of the components.
.. Defining the execution logic of the components, also called runtime.
. xref:index-testing-components.adoc[Testing the components].
. xref:index-deploying-components.adoc[Deploying the components] to Talend Studio or Cloud applications.

Optionally, you can use xref:index-defining-services.adoc[services]. Services are predefined or user-defined configurations that can be reused in several components.
