:description: How to define an interceptor using Talend Component Kit services
:keywords: service, component-manager, interceptor

For common concerns such as caching, auditing, and so on, you can use an interceptor-like API. It is enabled on services by the framework.

An interceptor defines an annotation marked with `@Intercepts`, which defines the implementation of the interceptor (`InterceptorHandler`).

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Intercepts(LoggingHandler.class)
@Target({ TYPE, METHOD })
@Retention(RUNTIME)
public @interface Logged {
    String value();
}
----

The handler is created from its constructor and can take service injections (by type). The first parameter, however, can be `BiFunction<Method, Object[], Object>`, which represents the invocation chain if your interceptor can be used with others.

IMPORTANT: If you make a generic interceptor, pass the invoker as first parameter. Otherwise you cannot combine interceptors at all.

Here is an example of interceptor implementation for the `@Logged` API:

[source,java]
----
public class LoggingHandler implements InterceptorHandler {
    // injected
    private final BiFunction<Method, Object[], Object> invoker;
    private final SomeService service;

    // internal
    private final ConcurrentMap<Method, String> loggerNames = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public LoggingHandler(final BiFunction<Method, Object[], Object> invoker, final SomeService service) {
        this.invoker = invoker;
        this.service = service;
    }

    @Override
    public Object invoke(final Method method, final Object[] args) {
        final String name = loggerNames.computeIfAbsent(method, m -> findAnnotation(m, Logged.class).get().value());
        service.getLogger(name).info("Invoking {}", method.getName());
        return invoker.apply(method, args);
    }
}
----

This implementation is compatible with interceptor chains because it takes the invoker as first constructor parameter and it also takes a service injection. Then, the implementation simply does what is needed, which is logging the invoked method in this case.

NOTE: The `findAnnotation` annotation, inherited from `InterceptorHandler`, is an utility method to find an annotation on a method or class (in this order).
