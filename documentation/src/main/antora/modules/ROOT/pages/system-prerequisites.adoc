In order to use Talend Component Kit, you need the following tools installed on your machine:

* Java JDK 1.8.x. You can download it from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Oracle] website.
* Talend Open Studio 7.0 or greater to integrate your components.
* A Java Integrated Development Environment such as Eclipse or IntelliJ. IntelliJ is recommended as a Talend Component Kit plugin is available.
* Optional: If you use IntelliJ, you can install the xref:installing-talend-intellij-plugin.adoc[Talend Component Kit plugin for IntelliJ].
* Optional: A build tool:
- Apache Maven 3.5.4 is recommended to develop a component or the project itself. You can download it from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi?Preferred=ftp%3A%2F%2Fmirror.reverse.net%2Fpub%2Fapache%2F[Apache Maven] website. +
- You can also use Gradle, but at the moment certain features are not supported, such as validations. +
+
NOTE:  It is optional to install a build tool independently since Maven and Gradle wrappers are already available with Talend Component Kit.
