:keywords: framework

_Talend Component Kit_ is a toolkit based on Java and designed to simplify the development of components at two levels:

* **Runtime**: Runtime is about injecting the specific component code into a job or pipeline. The framework helps unify as much as possible the code required to run in Data Integration (DI) and BEAM environments.
* **Graphical interface**: The framework helps unify the code required to be able to render the component in a browser (web) or in the Eclipse-based Studio (SWT).

== Framework tools

The *Talend Component Kit* framework is made of several tools designed to help you during the component development process. It allows to develop components that fit in both Java web UIs.

* *Starter*: Generate the skeleton of your development project using a user-friendly interface. The *Talend Component Kit Starter* is available as a https://starter-toolkit.talend.io[web tool] or as a https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10558-talend-component-kit--intellij-plugin[plugin for the IntelliJ IDE].

* *Component API*: Check all classes available to implement components.
* *Build tools*: The framework comes with xref:build-tools-maven.adoc[Maven] and xref:build-tools-gradle.adoc[Gradle] wrappers, which allow to always use the version of Maven or Gradle that is right for your component development environment and version.
* *Testing tools*: Test components before integrating them into Talend Studio or Cloud applications. Testing tools include the *Talend Component Kit Web Tester*, which allows to check the web UI of your components on your local machine.
