From there, Talend Component Kit wraps the data to allow you to access it as a map. The parameter type is not enforced. This means that if you know you will get a SuperCustomDto, then you can use it as parameter type. But for generic components that are reusable in any chain, it is highly encouraged to use Record until you have an evaluation language-based processor that has its own way to access components.","For example:","A processor also supports @BeforeGroup and @AfterGroup methods, which must not have any parameter and return void values. Any other result would be ignored. These methods are used by the runtime to mark a chunk of the data in a way which is estimated good for the execution flow size.","Because the size is estimated, the size of a group can vary. It is even possible to have groups of size 1.","It is recommended to batch records, for performance reasons:","You can optimize the data batch processing by using the maxBatchSize parameter. This parameter is automatically implemented on the component when it is deployed to a Talend application. Only the logic needs to be implemented. You can however customize its value setting in your LocalConfiguration the property _maxBatchSize.value - for the family - or ${component simple class name}._maxBatchSize.value - for a particular component, otherwise its default will be 1000. Learn how to implement chunking/bulking in this document.","In some cases, you may need to split the output of a processor in two or more connections. A common example is to have \"main\" and \"reject\" output connections where part of the incoming data are passed to a specific bucket and processed later.","Talend Component Kit supports two types of output connections: Flow and Reject.","Flow is the main and standard output connection.","The Reject connection handles records rejected during the processing. A component can only have one reject connection, if any. Its name must be REJECT to be processed correctly in Talend applications.","You can also define the different output connections of your component in the Starter.","To define an output connection, you can use @Output as replacement of the returned value in the @ElementListener:","Alternatively, you can pass a string that represents the new branch:","Having multiple inputs is similar to having multiple outputs, except that an OutputEmitter wrapper is not needed:","@Input takes the input name as parameter. If no name is set, it defaults to the \"main (default)\" input branch. It is recommended to use the default branch when possible and to avoid naming branches according to the component semantic.","Depending on several requirements, including the system capacity and business needs, a processor can process records differently.","For example, for real-time or near-real time processing, it is more interesting to process small batches of data more often. On the other hand, in case of one-time processing, it is more optimal to adapt the way the component handles batches of data according to the system capacity.","By default, the runtime automatically estimates a group size that it considers good, according to the system capacity, to process the data. This group size can sometimes be too big and not optimal for your needs or for your system to handle effectively and correctly.","Users can then customize this size from the component settings in Talend Studio, by specifying a maxBatchSize that adapts the size of each group of data to be processed.","The estimated group size logic is automatically implemented when a component is deployed to a Talend application. Besides defining the @BeforeGroup and @AfterGroup logic detailed below, no action is required on the implementation side of the component.","The component batch processes the data as follows:","Case 1 - No maxBatchSize is specified in the component configuration. The runtime estimates a group size of 4. Records are processed by groups of 4.","Case 2 - The runtime estimates a group size of 4 but a maxBatchSize of 3 is specified in the component configuration. The system adapts the group size to 3. Records are processed by groups of 3.","","Each group is processed as follows until there is no record left:","The @BeforeGroup method resets a record buffer at the beginning of each group.","The records of the group are assessed one by one and placed in the buffer as follows: The @ElementListener method tests if the buffer size is greater or equal to the defined maxBatchSize. If it is, the records are processed. If not, then the current record is buffered.","The previous step happens for all records of the group. Then the @AfterGroup method tests if the buffer is empty.","","You can define the following logic in the processor configuration:","You can also use the condensed syntax for this kind of processor:","You can learn more about processors in this document.","Defining a processor/output logic","General component execution logic","Implementing bulk processing","Best practices","For the case of output components (not emitting any data) using bulking you can pass the list of records to the after group method:"]},{"lang":"en","title":"<a href=\"#\">Defining an output</a>","version":"1.1.8","url":"https://talend.github.io/component-runtime/main/1.1.8/component-output.html","date":"2025-05-27T00:55:02Z","timestamp":1748307302408,"lvl0":["Defining an output"],"lvl1":["What is an output"],"description":"How to develop an output component with Talend Component Kit","keywords":"component type, output, processor","text":["An Output is a Processor that does not return any data.","Conceptually, an output is a data listener.

and dependencies are loaded.","keywords":"plugin, scanning","text":["Talend Component scanning is based on plugins. To make sure that plugins can be developed in parallel and avoid conflicts, they need to be isolated (component or group of components in a single jar/plugin).","Multiple options are available:","Graph classloading: this option allows you to link the plugins and dependencies together dynamically in any direction. For example, the graph classloading can be illustrated by OSGi containers.","Tree classloading: a shared classloader inherited by plugin classloaders. However, plugin classloader classes are not seen by the shared classloader, nor by other plugins. For example, the tree classloading is commonly used by Servlet containers where plugins are web applications.","Flat classpath: listed for completeness but rejected by design because it doesn’t comply with this requirement.","In order to avoid much complexity added by this layer, Talend Component Kit relies on a tree classloading. The advantage is that you don’t need to define the relationship with other plugins/dependencies, because it is built-in.","Here is a representation of this solution:","","The shared area contains Talend Component Kit API, which only contains by default the classes shared by the plugins.","Then, each plugin is loaded with its own classloader and dependencies.","This section explains the overall way to handle dependencies but the Talend Maven plugin provides a shortcut for that.","A plugin is a JAR file that was enriched with the list of its dependencies. By default, Talend Component Kit runtime is able to read the output of maven-dependency-plugin in TALEND-INF/dependencies.txt. You just need to make sure that your component defines the following plugin:","Once build, check the JAR file and look for the following lines:","What is important to see is the scope related to the artifacts:","The APIs (component-api0 and geronimo-annotation_1.3_spec) are provided because you can consider them to be there when executing (they come with the framework).","Your specific dependencies (awesome-project in the example above) are marked as compile: they are included as needed dependencies by the framework (note that using runtime works too).","the other dependencies are ignored. For example, test dependencies.","Even if a flat classpath deployment is possible, it is not recommended because it would then reduce the capabilities of the components.","The way the framework resolves dependencies is based on a local Maven repository layout. As a quick reminder, it looks like:","This is all the layout the framework uses. The logic converts t-uple {groupId, artifactId, version, type (jar)} to the path in the repository.","Talend Component Kit runtime has two ways to find an artifact:","From the file system based on a configured Maven 2 repository.","From a fat JAR (uber JAR) with a nested Maven repository under MAVEN-INF/repository.","The first option uses either ${user.home}/.m2/repository (default) or a specific path configured when creating a ComponentManager. The nested repository option needs some configuration during the packaging to ensure the repository is correctly created.","To create the nested MAVEN-INF/repository repository, you can use the nested-maven-repository extension:","Plugins are usually programmatically registered. If you want to make some of them automatically available, you need to generate a TALEND-INF/plugins.properties file that maps a plugin name to coordinates found with the Maven mechanism described above.","You can enrich maven-shade-plugin to do it:","Here is a final job/application bundle based on maven-shade-plugin:","The configuration unrelated to transformers depends on your application.","ContainerDependenciesTransformer embeds a Maven repository and PluginTransformer to create a file that lists (one per line) artifacts (representing plugins).","Both transformers share most of their configuration:","session: must be set to ${session}. This is used to retrieve dependencies.","scope: a comma-separated list of scopes to include in the artifact filtering (note that the default will rely on provided but you can replace it by compile, runtime, runtime+compile, runtime+system or test).","include: a comma-separated list of artifacts to include in the artifact filtering.","exclude: a comma-separated list of artifacts to exclude in the artifact filtering.","userArtifacts: set of artifacts to include (groupId, artifactId, version, type - optional, file - optional for plugin transformer, scope - optional) which can be forced inline. This parameter is mainly useful for PluginTransformer.","includeTransitiveDependencies: should transitive dependencies of the components be included. Set to true by default. It is active for userArtifacts.","includeProjectComponentDependencies: should component project dependencies be included. Set to false by default. It is not needed when a job project uses isolation for components.","With the component tooling, it is recommended to keep default locations. Also if you need to use project dependencies, you can need to refactor your project structure to ensure component isolation. Talend Component Kit lets you handle that part but the recommended practice is to use userArtifacts for the components instead of project <dependencies>.","ContainerDependenciesTransformer specific configuration is as follows:","repositoryBase: base repository location (MAVEN-INF/repository by default).","ignoredPaths: a comma-separated list of folders not to create in the output JAR. This is common for folders already created by other transformers/build parts.","ContainerDependenciesTransformer specific configuration is the following one:","pluginListResource: base repository location (default to TALEND-INF/plugins.properties).","For example, if you want to list only the plugins you use, you can configure this transformer as follows:","The framework uses two kind of filterings when scanning your component. One based on the JAR name and one based on the package name. Make sure that your component definitions (including services) are in a scanned module if they are not registered manually using ComponentManager.instance().addPlugin(), and that the component package is not excluded.","To find components the framework can scan the classpath but in this case, to avoid to scan the whole classpath which can be really huge an impacts a lot the startup time, several

You can inject the test handler - which has some utilities for advanced cases - through @HttpApiInject:","The injection is optional and the @HttpApi annotation allows you to configure several test behaviors.","For tests using SSL-based services, you need to use @HttpApi(useSsl = true).","You can access the client SSL socket factory through the API handler:","The strength of this implementation is to run a small proxy server and to auto-configure the JVM: http[s].proxyHost, http[s].proxyPort, HttpsURLConnection#defaultSSLSocketFactory and SSLContext#default are auto-configured to work out-of-the-box with the proxy.","It allows you to keep the native and real URLs in your tests. For example, the following test is valid:","If you execute this test, it fails with an HTTP 400 error because the proxy does not find the mocked response. You can create it manually, as described in component-runtime-http-junit, but you can also set the talend.junit.http.capture property to the folder storing the captures. It must be the root folder and not the folder where the JSON files are located (not prefixed by talend/testing/http by default).","In most cases, use src/test/resources. If new File(\"src/test/resources\") resolves the valid folder when executing your test (Maven default), then you can just set the system property to true. Otherwise, you need to adjust accordingly the system property value.","When the tests run with this system property, the testing framework creates the correct mock response files. After that, you can remove the system property. The tests will still pass, using google.com, even if you disconnect your machine from the Internet.","If you set the talend.junit.http.passthrough system property to true, the server acts as a proxy and executes each request to the actual server - similarly to the capturing mode.","With its @ParameterizedTest, you can want to customize the name of the output file for JUnit 5 based captures/mocks. Concretely you want to ensure the replay of the same method with different data lead to different mock files. By default the framework will use the display name of the test to specialize it but it is not always very friendly. If you want some more advanced control over the name you can use @HttpApiName(\"myCapture.json\") on the test method. To parameterize the name using @HttpApiName, you can use the placeholders ${class} and ${method} which represents the declaring class and method name, and ${displayName} which represents the method name.","Here is an example to use the same capture file for all repeated test:","And here, the same example but using different files for each repetition:"]}]
